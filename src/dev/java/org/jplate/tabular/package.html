<body>
    This package is provides table parsing/building functionality for tabular
    related data such as CDV (colon delimited values), CSV (comma separated
    values) and TDV (tabbed delimited values).  Ideally, the classes contained
    herein will reflect what one will be required to do to utilize the table
    oriented parsers.

    <p/>

    Tables contain data organized individually into records and fields.  Both
    are separated by common delimeters such as a comma for fields and newlines
    for records.

    <p/>

    Ease of use classes can be found in {@link org.jplate.tabular.util}.  Many
    of these classes use default implementations for builders and parsers
    allowing for quick use.  If more specific needs are required, looking at
    the classes here should help illustrate how to accomplish this.

    <p/>

    Tabular markups can be found at: 

    <ul>
    <li>{@link org.jplate.tabular.cdv.parser}</li>
    <li>{@link org.jplate.tabular.csv.parser}</li>
    <li>{@link org.jplate.tabular.tdv.parser}</li>
    </ul>

    <p/>

    <b><i>Please note:</i></b>for code examples look to individual classes.
