    Contains all JPlate parser related functionality.  This project defines the
    following concepts:

    <ul>
        <li>
            A parser:  parses streams, files, strings, etc.  Utilizes a builder to
            create items when "choice" points are encountered during parsing.
        </li>

        <li>
            A builder:  creates items on behalf of a parser.
        </li>

        <li>
            Factories:  for creating instances of parsers and/or builders.
        </li>
    </ul>

    Delegating parsing and building as described above keeps parsers fairly static
    by varying builder implementations based upon problem domain.

    <p/>

    For example, consider the case where one uses tabbed delimited files for
    insertion into a database but decides to temporarily display the fields as found
    in the file (perhaps due to some errors in the data).  The tabbed delimited
    parser can remain the same - it simply parses tabbed delimited streams.  Two
    builder implementations can be written:  one for database import, another for
    outputting the values found to the console.
