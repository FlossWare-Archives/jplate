    Base package for the "Gang of Four" Chain of Responsibility pattern: <i>"Avoid
    coupling the sender of a request to its receiver by giving more than one object
    a chance to handle the request - chain the receiving objects and pass the
    request along the chain until an object handles it,"</i>
    p223 Design Patterns - Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software.
