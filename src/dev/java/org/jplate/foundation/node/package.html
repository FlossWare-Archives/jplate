    Base package for nodes.A node is represented as follows:
    
    <p/>

    <ul>
        <li>Leaf node: a childless node.</li>
        <li>Branch node: a node with zero or more child nodes.  Each child is either
        a leaf node or a branch node.</li>
    </ul>

    All nodes have a "context" that represents the content of that node
    (for instance a String).
    
    <p/>
