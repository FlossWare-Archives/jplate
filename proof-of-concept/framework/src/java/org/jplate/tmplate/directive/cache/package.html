    This package provides the implementation of directive caches as well as
    functionality to create instances.  A directive cache acts as a repository
    of named/pcdata (parsed character) directives
        
    <p>
    <b>Usage</b>

    <p>
    To create an instance of
    <code>org.jplate.tmplate.directive.DirectiveCacheIfc</code>, please do
    the following (assume klass has been instantiated):

<pre>
    //
    // Assume klass instantiated before this point...
    //
    final DirectiveCacheFactoryMgrIfc factoryMgr =
        DirectiveCacheFactoryMgrIfc.getSingleton ();

    final DirectiveCacheFactoryIfc factory =
        factoryMgr.getFactory ( klass );

    final DirectiveCacheIfc directiveCache =
        factory.createDirectiveCache ();
</pre>

    <b>Please note:</b>  One can create a pre-populated cache by utilizing
    the <code>DirectiveCacheFactoryIfc.createDirectiveCache ( NamedDirectiveDefIfc namedDirectives[] )</code> method.
