    This package provides the implementation of the named directive definition
    as well as functionality to create instances.  A named directive definition
    simply associates a textual name (<code>java.lang.String</code>) with a
    named directive (a 1 to 1 mapping).

    <p>
    <b>Usage</b>

    <p>
    To create an instance of
    <code>org.jplate.tmplate.directive.NamedDirectiveDefIfc</code>, please do
    the following (assume klass, name and namedDirective have been
    instantiated):

<pre>
    //
    // Assume klass, name and namedDirective instantiated before this point...
    //
    final NamedDirectiveDefFactoryMgrIfc factoryMgr =
        NamedDirectiveDefFactoryMgrIfc.getSingleton ();

    final NamedDirectiveDefFactoryIfc factory = factoryMgr.getFactory ( klass );

    final NamedDirectiveDefIfc namedDirectiveDef =
        factory.createNamedDirectiveDef ( name, namedDirective );
</pre>

    @see org.jplate.tmplate.directive.NamedDirectiveDefIfc
</body>
