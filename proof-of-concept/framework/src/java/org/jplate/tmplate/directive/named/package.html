    This package provides useful implementations of
    <code>org.jplate.tmplate.directive.NamedDirectiveIfc</code>.  It is
    important to note that when a directive container requests a named directive
    to translate, the named directive has the "ultimate say" as to what that
    translation becomes.  One can examine the contents of the directive
    container and operate upon the contents or it can do something completely
    different.  Some good examples are:

    <ul>
        <li>
            <code>org.jplate.tmplate.directive.named.AliasDirective</code>:
            when translating it names a directive (ie creates a new named
            directive) whose contents are those defined within the alias
            directive block.  Essentially it takes the contents of its'
            directive container, creates a new named directive who will
            return those contents when asked to translate.
        </li>
        <li>
            <code>org.jplate.tmplate.directive.named.DateDirective</code>:  when
            translating it simply computes the date/time based upon a
            filtering string.
        </li>
    </ul>
