    This is the base package for JPlate directives.  This package and its
    subpackages provide the functionality to process JPlate templates.

    <p>
    <b>Please note:</b>  this is but one implementation that can be used to
    process results from the JPlate parser.  However, it is a complete
    implementation that will most likely be used in favor of "rolling" your own.
