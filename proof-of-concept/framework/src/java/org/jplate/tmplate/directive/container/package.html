    This package provides the implementation of directive containers as well as
    functionality to create instances.  A directive container acts as a
    container of <code>org.jplate.directive.DirectiveContainerIfc</code>'s (both
    a parent and many children), a 
    <code>org.jplate.directive.DirectiveIfc</code> (for translation), a
    <code>org.jplate.directive.DirectiveCacheIfc</code> (repository for named
    directives), and a <code>org.jplate.util.environment.EnvironmentIfc</code>
    (to contain attributes and/or key/object pairs).
    
    <p>
    As mentioned, when translating the directive container uses a
    <code>org.jplate.directive.DirectiveIfc</code> for translation.  The
    directive container will present itself to the directive for which it
    can gather data to aid in translation for the container.  By structuring the
    code in this fashion, the directive container is able to do what it does
    best:  containment.  Allowing the container to use a directive for
    translation is an example of the <i>Strategy Pattern</i>.

    <p>
    <b>Usage</b>

    <p>
    To create an instance of
    <code>org.jplate.tmplate.directive.DirectiveContainerIfc</code>, please do
    the following (assume klass has been instantiated):

<pre>
    //
    // Assume klass instantiated before this point...
    //
    final DirectiveContainerFactoryMgrIfc factoryMgr =
        DirectiveContainerFactoryMgrIfc.getSingleton ();

    final DirectiveContainerFactoryIfc factory =
        factoryMgr.getFactory ( klass );

    final DirectiveContainerIfc directiveContainer =
        factory.createDirectiveContainer ();
</pre>
