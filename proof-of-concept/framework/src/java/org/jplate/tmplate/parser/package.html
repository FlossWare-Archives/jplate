    Provides the parser functionality for the JPlate Template Engine.

    The syntax for the Template Engine contains parsed characer data (raw data)
    and named directives.  The notation is hierarchical and very similar to XML
    without some of the restrictions placed upon XML documents to be well
    formed.

    <p>
    <b>Definitions</b>

    <p>
    The following define the contents of a JPlate Template:

    <ul>
        <li>
            Parsed Character Data (PCData):  is raw data.  It is not translated
            and can exist in any form.
        </li>

        <li>
            Directives:  specially "tagged" areas enclosed in ${  }.

            <p>
            Internally within ${  } the rules are similar to XML:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Directive name:  a letter followed by zero or more
                    letters/numbers.  This is mandatory.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Name/value pairs:

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Name:  a letter followed by zero or more
                            letters/numbers.  This is optional.
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            Value:  an equals sign followed by a double quote
                            followed by any characters and finally followed by
                            a double quote.  This is optional.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                    <b>Please note:</b>  There can be any number of name/value
                    pairs or none.  A name may have an optional value.
                </li>
            </ul>

            Directives come in two flavors:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Stand alone:  a directive that contains no child
                    elements and is denoted using ${  /} (this is similar to
                    a childless XML element.

                    <p>
                    The following are some stand alone directives:

<pre>
    ${Foo/}

    ${Bar start end="12:00"/}

    ${zeta5 singularity="true" multiverse"=False"/}
</pre>
                </li>

                <li>
                    Hierarchical:  a directive that is denoted by start and
                    end tags:
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Start tag:  ${  }
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            End tag:  ${/  }
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    PCData or additional directives can be contained between
                    the directive start and end tags.  The following are some
                    hierarchical directives:

<pre>
    ${Foo}
        This is the contents of directive, Foo...
    ${/Foo}

    ${Bar start}
        This is the contents of directive, Bar...
    ${/Bar}

    ${GrandParent}
        Some data

        ${Parent first="Scot" last="Floess"
            I am so great

            ${Child nickname="Tabbi" female}
                My daughter

                ${Pet animal="Rabbit" name="Jack"/}
            ${/Child}

            No more data
        {$/Parent}

        ${Date today/}
    ${/GrandParent}
</pre>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    <b>Please note:</b>  the template engine does no data organization
    whatsoever.  Data organization is up to implementations of
    <code>org.jplate.tmplate.parser.JPlateParserStrategyIfc</code> - and is
    required to parse.  The interface is an example of the Design Pattern
    <I>Strategy</I>.  Structuring the parser in this fashion keeps it simple as
    well as allowing implementations to decide the correct "meaning" of the
    JPlate data.
