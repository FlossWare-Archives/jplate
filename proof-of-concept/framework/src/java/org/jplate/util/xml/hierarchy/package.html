This package simplifies manipulating <code>org.w3c.dom.Document</code> objects.

The hierarchy family of classes assumes a less generic (specific) approach to
document management.  Specifically, a hierarchy consists of:

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Name:</b>  This is the name of the node and is represented by a
        <code>java.lang.String</code>.
    </li>

    <p>

    <li>
        <b>Value:</b>  This is the optional CDATA section of a node and is
        represented by a <code>java.lang.String</code>.
    </li>

    <p>

    <li>
        <b>Attributes:</b>  This is the optional attributes of a node and is
        represented by an array of
        <code>org.jplate.util.xml.hierarchy.AttributeIfc</code>.  
        <b>Please note:</b>  If there are no attributes, this will be an array
        of size 0.
    </li>

    <p>

    <li>
        <b>Children:</b>  This is the optional children of a node represented by
        an array of <code>org.jplate.util.xml.hierarchy.HierarchyIfc</code>.  
        <b>Please note:</b>  If no children exist, this will be an array of size
        0.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>

Based upon the aforementioned, assume the following XML:

<p>
<pre>
&lt;foo&gt;
    &lt;bar att1="val1" att2="val2"&gt;
        My bar description
        &lt;zeta/&gt;
    &lt;/bar&gt;
&lt;/foo&gt;
</pre>

The hierarchies are:

<pre>
    name = "Foo", value = "", AttributeIfc [ 0 ], Children:
    
        name = "bar", value = "My bar description",
        attributes = [ name = "attr1"/val = "val1", name = "att2"/val = "val2 ],
        Children:

            name = "zeta", value = "", AttributeIfc [ 0 ],
            HierarchyIfc [ 0 ]
</pre>

Essentially, hierarchies are concerned with names, values, attributes and
children.  All other portions of XML are not considered - such as comments, etc.

<p>
<b>Useage</b>

<p>
To create a hierarchy, perform the following (assume an
<code>org.w3c.dom.Document</code>, document, has been created):

<pre>
final HierarchyFactoryIfc hierarchyFactory =
    HierarchyFactory.getSingleton ();

final HierarchyIfc hierarchy =
    hierarchyFactory.createHierarchyFromDocument ( document );

// Perform operations on hierarchy...
<pre>
</body>
