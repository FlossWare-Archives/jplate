Provides the framework/template for definining factories to be used when classes
are presented as the context in which the factory is to be used.

<p>
This family of classes exemplifies the Design Patterns concept of the Factory
Method, <i>"provide an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses
decide which class to instantiate."</i>  The important difference between this
definition and the factory context package is that a class context dictates the
factory to instantiate.

<p>
<b>Definitions/Concepts</b>

<p>
To exploit this package one should define a contract (interface)/implementation,
factory interface/implementation, and factory manager:

<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Contract (interface)/implementations:</b>  The contract is simply an
        interface.  It defines the "contract" (API) that an object will support.
        The implementations should have package protected constructors and live
        in the same package as the factory implementations (so that it cannot be
        created by classes outside of its package).  As will be seen later, a
        great deal of power can be achieved utilizing factories for
        instantiation.
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Factory interface/implementation:</b>  The factory interface should
        have create() method(s) that return implementations of the contract
        defined above.  Factory implementations should be public classes who
        implement the factory interface.  Due to the dynamic nature of
        FactoryContext (i.e. using <code>Class.forName </code> the classes must
        be public).
    </li>

    <li>
        <b>Factory manager:</b>   The factory manager will return instances of
        the factory interface and should utilize FactoryContext in returning the
        se implementations of the interface.  It is important to note that a
        <code> java.lang.Class</code> should be presented to the factory manager
        as that is used in finding implementations of
        <code>org.jplate.factory.FactoryIfc</code>.  Also of importance is that
        the factory manager implement </code>org.jplate.factory.FactoryMgrIfc
        </code> as FactoryContext keys off this interface in finding all the
        factories defined.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
<b>Please note:</b>  <code>org.jplate.factory.FactoryIfc</code> and 
<code>org.jplate.factory.FactoryMgrIfc</code> are simply marker interfaces. 
Although they contain no methods, it provides a trivial contract ensuring
factories are used.

<p><p>
In summary:  to retrieve a factory, one should use a factory manager and
present the factory manager with a class when requesting a factory interface.

<p>
<b>Please note:</b>  FactoryContext uses an XML file containing class names that
map to factory class names.  Also definable is a default factory - which is
shorthand for "if the class provided is not defined, return the default
factory."  Please scroll to the end to see the XML file structure.

<p>
All of this is extremely powerful.  By utilizing this functionality as a
template for factories, one can dictate at runtime, what implementation of a
factory should be returned to any class.  If one utilizes the factory paradigm
then it is possible to do things like enable tracing for a given type based
upon the class requesting a factory.

<p>
It is encouraged that all factory manager/factory interface/factory
implementations use the factory context package to simplify the aforementioned
fucntionality.

<p>
<b>Examples</b>

</p>
The following is a simplified example of how to retrieve a factory based upon a
some object's <code>getClass()</code>

<pre>
//
// Assume factoryMgr has been assigned some FactoryMgrIfc...
//
FactoryContextIfc factoryContext = FactoryContext.getSingleton ();

FactoryIfc factory = 
  factoryContext.getFactoryContext ( factoryMgr, getClass () );

//
// Use factory to create objects...
//
</pre>

Ideally, the above functionality will be wrapped in actual implementations.  For
instance, assume one works with Foo's and wants to support factory contexts to
gain robust functionality:

<pre>

//
// The foo interface...albeit trivial...
//
public interface FooIfc
{
    public void setX ( int x );
    public int getX ();
}

//
// The foo implementation.  Notice it is package protected and should be created
// using a factory.
//
final class Foo implements FooIfc
{
    private int _x;

    Foo ()
    {
    }

    public void setX ( final int x )
    {
        _x = x;
    }
    
    public int getX ()
    {
        return _x;
    }
}

//
// This is the factory definition to create Foo's...
//
public interface FooFactoryIfc extends org.jplate.factory.FactoryIfc
{
    public FooIfc createFoo ();
}

//
// The foo factory implementation.
//
public final class FooFactory implements FooFactoryIfc
{
    public FooFactory ()
    {
    }

    public FooIfc createFoo ()
    {
        return new Foo ();
    }
}

//
// This is the foo factory manager who manages an implementation of the foo
// factory interface.
//
public class FooFactoryMgr implements org.jplate.factory.FactoryMgrIfc
{
    private final FooFactoryIfc _defaultFactory;

    public FooFactoryMgr ()
    {
        final org.jplate.util.factorycontext.FactoryContext factoryContext =
            org.jplate.util.factorycontext.FactoryContext.getSingleton ();

        _defaultFactory =
            ( FooFactoryIfc ) factoryContext.getDefaultFactory ( this );
    }

    public FooFactoryIfc getDefaultFactory ()
    {
        return _defaultFactory;
    }

    public FooFactoryIfc getFactory ( final Class classContext )
    {
        final org.jplate.util.factorycontext.FactoryContext factoryContext =
            org.jplate.util.factorycontext.FactoryContext.getSingleton ();

        FooFactoryIfc factory =
            ( FooFactoryIfc )
                factoryContext.getFactoryForContext ( this, classContext );

        return factory != null ? factory : _defaultFactory;
    }
}
</pre>

Consider the above a template to structuring code using the factory context
family of classes.  This may not appear overly powerful, but consider the
situation where it is now desirable to add tracing capabilities to foo's.  Of
course it is possible to add checks to Foo.java to see if tracing is enabled and
if so trace, but that detracts from Foo's initial requirements.

<p>
The following illustrates how tracing can be added for Foo.java without
changing the code.  Please note that this is an example of the
<i>Decorator Pattern</i>.

<pre>
//
// This class acts as a Decorator for a FooIfc adding System.out functionality
//
final class TraceableFoo implements FooIfc
{
    final FooIfc _foo;

    private TraceableFoo ()
    {
    }

    TraceableFoo ( final FooIfc foo )
    {
        _foo = foo;
    }

    public void setX ( final int x )
    {
        System.out.println ( "Setting x = <" + x + ">" );
        _foo.setX ( x );
    }

    public int getX ()
    {
        final int x = _foo.getX ();

        System.out.println ( "Returning x = <" + x + ">" );

        return retVal;
    }
}

//
// The traceable foo factory implementation.
//
public final class TraceableFooFactory implements FooFactoryIfc
{
    //
    // We need to create some kind of Foo.  Since any class can have
    // a foo factory defined for it, it is reasonable that one was set
    // for self.
    //
    private final FooFactoryIfc _myFooFactory;

    public TraceableFooFactory ()
    {
        final FooFactoryMgr fooFactoryMgr = new FooFactoryMgr ();

        _myFooFactory = fooFactoryMgr.getFactory ( getClass () );
    }

    public FooIfc createFoo ()
    {
        return new TraceableFoo ( _myFooFactory.createFoo () );
    }
}
</pre>

As can be seen above, it is now a simple matter to enable tracing for any
foo.  The above could also have been written as:

<pre>
//
// This class acts as a Decorator for a FooIfc adding System.out functionality
//
final class TraceableFoo implements FooIfc
{
    final FooIfc _foo;

    private TraceableFoo ()
    {
        //
        // We need to create some kind of Foo.  Since any class can have
        // a foo factory defined for it, it is reasonable that one was set
        // for self.
        //
        final FooFactoryMgr fooFactoryMgr = new FooFactoryMgr ();

        final FooFactoryIfc myFooFactory =
            fooFactoryMgr.getFactory ( getClass () );

        _foo = myFooFactory.createFoo ();
    }

    public void setX ( final int x )
    {
        System.out.println ( "Setting x = <" + x + ">" );
        _foo.setX ( x );
    }

    public int getX ()
    {
        final int x = _foo.getX ();

        System.out.println ( "Returning x = <" + x + ">" );

        return retVal;
    }
}

//
// The traceable foo factory implementation.
//
public final class TraceableFooFactory implements FooFactoryIfc
{
    public TraceableFooFactory ()
    {
    }

    public FooIfc createFoo ()
    {
        return new TraceableFoo ();
    }
}
</pre>

Since the factory context family of classes is used above, it is now trivial
to decide which foo factory should be returned from the foo factory manager
based upon a class.  For instance, one can enable foo tracing if a Bar class
is using foo's.  Or, one could enable tracing by default and enable standard
foo functionality only for Bar classes.

<p><p>
<b>The XML File</b>

<p>
FactoryContext defines classes using the org.jplate.util.propertymgr family of
classes.  As such, the XML file structure is the same, but its content is
pertenant to <code>org.jplate.factory.FactoryMgr</code>'s and
<code>org.jplate.factory.FactoryIfc</code>'s.  The following uses some
pseudonames to illustrate:

<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE factory-context SYSTEM "org.jplate.util.factorycontext.FactoryContext.dtd"&gt;

&lt;factory-context&gt;
    &lt;factory-mgr class="factory-mgr-class-name"&gt;
        &lt;context class="class-context"&gt;factory-class-name&gt;/context&gt;
        
        ...

        &lt;default&gt;default-factory-class-name&gt;/default&gt;
    &lt;factory-mgr&gt;

    ...

&lt;/factory-context&gt;
</pre>

Using the above example code, the following illustrates how to define foo
factories in terms of a Bar:

<pre>
&lt;?xml version="1.0"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE factory-context SYSTEM "org.jplate.util.factorycontext.FactoryContext.dtd"&gt;

&lt;factory-context&gt;
    &lt;factory-mgr class="FooFactoryMgr"&gt;
        &lt;context class="Bar"&gt;TraceableFooFactory&gt;/context&gt;

        &lt;default&gt;FooFactory&gt;/default&gt;
    &lt;factory-mgr&gt;
&lt;/factory-context&gt;
</pre>

<b>Please note:</b>  The above examples do not use packages.  However, in order
to work properly one must use fully qualified class names if the classes used
belong to packages!  This is no different than attempting to perform a
<code>Class.forName ( ... ).newInstance ()</code>
