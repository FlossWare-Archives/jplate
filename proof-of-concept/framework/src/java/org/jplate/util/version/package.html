Provides the capability to define a version file for things like builds.
Specifically, one can create a version definition in the following manner:

<ul>
    <li>
        To a file:  A file will be created containing the current date/time and
        a version number.

        <p>
        To create version <code>1.0</code> using file
        <code>/foo/bar/FooBld.vers</code> perform the following:

        <pre>
            final VersionFactoryIfc versionFactory =
                VersionFactory.getSingleton ();

            final Version version =
                versionFactory.createVersion ( "/foo/bar/FooBld.vers", "1.0" );
        </pre>
     </li>

    <p>
    <li>
        From a resource:  A resource representing an input stream containing
        the date/time of the version was created as the version number.

        <p>
        To retrieve a version whose resource is represented by
        <code>/foo/bar/FooBld.vers</code>, perform the following:

        <pre>
            final VersionFactoryIfc versionFactory =
                VersionFactory.getSingleton ();

            final Version version =
                versionFactory.createVersion ( "/foo/bar/FooBld.vers" );
        </pre>
    </li>
</ul>

</body>
