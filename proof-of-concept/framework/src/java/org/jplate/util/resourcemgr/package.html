<body>
Provides functionality to retrieve resources as input streams.

<p>
The classes in this package really do little more than
<code>getClass().getResourceAsStream ( &lt;some resource name&gt; )</code>.
However, using this package allows one set of classes to control where resources
are located and how they should be loaded - thus providing consistency.

<p>
<b>Please note:</b>  This package does not preclude loading resource
arbitrarily.  Doing so requires managing resources, their location and
distribution.

<p>
<b>Useage</b>

<p>
To retrieve a resource manager, do the following:

<pre>
    ResourceMgrIfc resourceMgr = ResourceMgr.getSingleton ();
</pre>

To retrieve a resource for resource <code>Foo.txt</code>, do the following:

<pre>
   InputStream fooIS = resourceMgr.getResource ( "Foo.txt" );
</pre>

<b>Please note:</b>  If the resource is not found, <code>null</code> will be
returned.
