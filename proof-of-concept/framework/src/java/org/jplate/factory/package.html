    This package defines marker interfaces for factories and factory managers.
    Although the interfaces contain no API, by implementing them it denotes
    their intended implementation.

    <p>
    <b>Definitions</b>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Factory:  a factory is used to create objects. 
        </li>

        <li>
            Factory Manager:  a factory manager "manages" instances of factories
            based upon a context (class).  There is also a "default" factory
            that a factory manager will return if using a context that is not
            defined.  
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    The reasons for defining these marker interfaces follows:

    <ul>
        <li>
            Factories:  factories do not create the same type of object, nor do
            they use the same data to construct said objects.  For instance, one
            factory may require a Bar to create a Foo whereas another factory
            may require nothing to create a Zeta.
        </li>

        <li>
            Factory managers:  factory managers do not manage the same type of
            factory.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    It can be argued that <code>FactoryMgrIfc</code> contain methods to return
    <code>FactoryIfc</code>.  However, ideally, one will typically not operate
    upon an implementation of <code>FactoryMgrIfc</code> generically because,
    once a <code>FactoryIfc</code> is retrieved one will still be required to
    know the exact subclassed interface.  As mentioned above, not all factories
    create objects in the same fashion.  Therefore there is no generic way to
    request a factory create an object.
